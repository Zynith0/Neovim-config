Hello!! This is my personal neovim configuration. This repo will be updated overtime as I continue to edit my configuration. It includes:

- lazy.nvim as a plugin manager
- Custom colors for the Catppuccin colorscheme
- Rose-Pine as the default colorscheme
- Remaps for the colemak-dh keyboard layout
- And much more!
